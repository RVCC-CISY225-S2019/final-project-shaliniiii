# Final Project
Web Dev I Final Project

Summary:
This project is a culmination of all previous projects completed throughout the semester. I seek to demonstrate all the new tools and features I've learned in Web Development using a combination of HTML, CSS, and later Bootstrap. 

Content Features in this project:
1. A header displaying a logo and page title
2. Navbar with responsive single page navigation using a <nav> element with links to parts of the page. A new navbar list item has been added to link to the new article I have included
3. Profile section including a profile photo and a bio. The profile photo has been stuled. The bio section has been rewritten and styled since Project 1. 
4. Photo gallery including 3 photos. 
5. Article (story) that was originally introduced in Project 5. First letter of the first paragraph of the story has a drop cap. 
6. An additional article (blog post) discussing an advanced CSS technique that I've chosen to feature and demonstrate. 
7. Contact form that was introduced in Project 5. Using CSS styling along with transform and transition effects, the submit button will show additional behavior when a mouse hovers over it and when it is clicked. 
8. Footer has a copyright notice and at least one social icon link to my GitHub account. 
  
Styling Features:
1. Typography. The web theme will contain a paired set of typefaces. There will be a font family for the display type which will be paired with a font family for the body type. The theme will include at least 2 different weights and italic style. 
2. Color - The web theme will include colors. The color scheme will include the hex codes and RGB values for the colors. Grayscale color values will be included, especially as it relates to typography. Contrast ratios will be noted in the inventory. Background colors may be gradients.
3. Logo - I have replaced the original blue origami logo with one of my own creation. The logo has been delivered both as an svg file and a png file for the favicon. 
4. Layout - The web page implements Responsive Web Design with a fluid layout, flexible images, and media queries. 
5. Pseudo class - The submit button has been modified to have some interactive behavior during the hover and click states. When a mouse hovers over the button and when it is clicked, some styling (color, border, size, font, etc.) should change making the button more interactive.
6. Drop cap on the first letter of the first paragraph of the story article. CSS code has been implemented to create a distinctive drop cap that matches the overall tone of the web page's theme. 
7. All HTML and CSS code has passed validation and been beautified.
